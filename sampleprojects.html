        NASA's Perseverance Rover started being developed in 2013. In 2020, it landed in the Jezero Crater on Mars and has been 
        exploring the planet ever since. There are a couple of things that set Perseverance apart from other rovers. For one, it was sent to Mars with 
        the express purpose of checking for signs of water and ancient life. Additionally, it has a couple of unique abilities. The first is that it can 
        drill samples of the rock on Mars, which will be picked up at a later date. The second is that it has a drone named "Ingenuity" that traveled to 
        Mars with Perseverance, and it uses the rover to navigate the Martian surface and to relay data.

        In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope, which is actually an international system of radio telescopes, released 
        an image of the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, which is relatively close to the Milky Way, at 
        around 55 million light-years away. The diameter of M87's event horizon (the orange disk of matter) is a little over 
        24 billion miles long, or around 1500 times the width of the solar system. The photo was generated by combining data from 8 different telescopes around the world.
