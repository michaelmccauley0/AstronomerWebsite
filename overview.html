    <h1 class="underline bold italic">What do Astronomers do?</h1>

    <p>Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, phenomena, and the universe as a whole.</p>
    <p>
        Astronomers study the universe by using satellites, telescopes, and other instruments to collect data.
        They then analyze and draw conclusions from this data by applying concepts from physics, math, and other related fields.
        Astronomers often use supercomputers to perform more sophisticated calculations, requiring them to maintain a
        modern understanding of technology and programming, much like someone working in computer science would.
        In analyzing the nature of the universe, astronomers advance science in ways that prove consequential for
        government entities, private companies, and educational institutions.
